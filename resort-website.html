    <p>Experience the thrill of big game fishing outside the barrier reef, snorkel in the calm ocean waters from a glass-bottomed boat, or try your hand at windsurfing or scuba diving. For those who adopt a more gentle approach, a walk through the indigenous forest provides an opportunity to spot several species of monkey and birds. For the golfers, improve your handicap at the nearby golf course.</p>
    <p>All-inclusive resorts are great at keeping their guests busy. Included yoga classes and dance lessons are a fun way to spend a less-than-sunny day, and free-to-use kayaks and snorkeling gear can get you away from the pool and into the ocean. But many resorts also offer additional activities and day-trips that aren't covered by the basic all-inclusive rate. (Usually the division between included and not lies with the type of activity. If the activity is "non-motorized," it's probably included. If it requires a ride off the property or a heavy piece of equipment, it probably requires an additional fee.) The good news? In many cases, that additional fee is worth it.</p>
